# Mobile Application in Dart(Mobile & Web)

Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a cross platform application which has built its ground in AndroidStudios and is written in dart. 

### Star Wars themed App

This Flutter application allows users to explore the Star Wars universe by choosing between two iconic sides: the Jedi Side or the Dark Side. The app is designed with a clean and engaging user interface, including themed backgrounds and character images for each side. The key features include:

Main Page: Offers two options for users to select from â€“ "Jedi Side" or "Dark Side".
Jedi Page: Displays a themed background and a character image representing the Jedi side, along with a welcoming message.
Dark Side Page: Presents a dark-themed background and a character image of Darth Vader (or a similar character) representing the Sith/Dark Side.
Depending on the user's choice, the app will navigate to the appropriate themed page, providing an immersive experience based on the chosen side of the Force.
